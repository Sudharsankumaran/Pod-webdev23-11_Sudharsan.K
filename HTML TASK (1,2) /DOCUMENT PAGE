       <P style="text-align: start; font-style: normal;">A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the development process, they must have expertise in both.</P>

        <p>A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses.</P>
